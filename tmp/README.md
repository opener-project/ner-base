TMP Directory
=============

This directory is used to write temporary output files of the test framework, as well as other temporary things that should not be committed to the repository.

The TMP dir should have no contents in the repository, other than this message. Please update the .gitignore file of the root of the repository with any filenames and/or extensions
that might end up in your tmp dir.
