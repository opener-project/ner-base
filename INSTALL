INSTALLING Version 1.0 of Apache OpenNLP nerc-en module
-------------------------------------------------------

Installing the nerc-en module only requires the following steps:

If you already have installed in your machine JDK7 and MAVEN 3, please go to step 3
directly.

	1. Install JDK 1.7.

            If you do not install JDK 1.7 in a default location, you will probably need to configure
            the PATH in .bashrc or .bash_profile:

	    export JAVA_HOME=/yourpath/local/java7
	    export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

            If you use tcsh you will need to specify it in your .login as follows:

            setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/java/java17

            setenv PATH ${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

            If you re-login into your shell and run the command

            java -version

            You should now see that your jdk is 1.7

	2. Install MAVEN 3.

            Download MAVEN 3 from

            wget http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/maven/maven-3/3.0.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz

            Now you need to configure the PATH. For Bash Shell:

            export MAVEN_HOME=/home/ragerri/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
	    export PATH=${MAVEN_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

            For tcsh shell:

            setenv MAVEN3_HOME ~/local/apache-maven-3.0.4

	    setenv PATH ${MAVEN3}/bin:{PATH}

	    If you re-login into your shell and run the command

            mvn -version

            You should see reference to the MAVEN version you have just installed plus the JDK 7 that is using.

	3. Download the nerc-en tarball.

	4. tar xvzf nerc-en.tgz and cd into nerc-es directory

	5. mvn install

	This step will create a directory called target/ which contains various directories and files.
	Most importantly, there you will find the module executable:

     	     nerc-en-1.0.jar

	To run the program execute:

   	   java -jar $PATH/target/nerc-en-1.0.jar -help

	or

	   bin/nerc-en -help

	and the available options to execute the program will be displayed.


GENERATING JAVADOC
----------------

You can also generate the javadoc of the module by executing:

    mvn javadoc:jar

Which will create a jar file target/nerc-es-1.0-javadoc.jar
