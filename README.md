IXA NERC-EN module
==================

This module provides a simple wrapper that uses Apache OpenNLP
programatically to recognize and classify Named Entities (NERC)
in running text.

The segmentation and tokenization models are provided by

http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/

The NERC models have been trained using the English CoNLL 2003 data and are provided
by the IXA NLP Group (ixa.si.ehu.es), University of the Basque Country.

Version 1.0 of nerc-en is being developed as part of the 7th Framework OpeNER European Project.

INSTALLING Version 1.0 of Apache OpenNLP nerc-en module
=======================================================

Installing the nerc-en module requires the following steps:

If you already have installed in your machine JDK7 and MAVEN 3, please go to step 3
directly. Otherwise, follow these steps:

1. Install JDK 1.7
-------------------

If you do not install JDK 1.7 in a default location, you will probably need to configure the PATH in .bashrc or .bash_profile:

````shell
export JAVA_HOME=/yourpath/local/java7
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
````

If you use tcsh you will need to specify it in your .login as follows:

````shell
setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/java/java17
setenv PATH ${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
````

If you re-login into your shell and run the command

````shell
java -version
````

You should now see that your jdk is 1.7

2. Install MAVEN 3
------------------

Download MAVEN 3 from

````shell
wget http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/maven/maven-3/3.0.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz
````

Now you need to configure the PATH. For Bash Shell:

````shell
export MAVEN_HOME=/home/ragerri/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
export PATH=${MAVEN_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
````

For tcsh shell:

````shell
setenv MAVEN3_HOME ~/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
setenv PATH ${MAVEN3}/bin:{PATH}
````

If you re-login into your shell and run the command

````shell
mvn -version
````

You should see reference to the MAVEN version you have just installed plus the JDK 7 that is using.

3. Get module from github
-------------------------

````shell
git clone git@github.com:opener-project/EHU-ner-lite_EN_kernel.git
````

4. Move into core directory
---------------------------

````shell
cd EHU-ner-lite_EN_kernel/core
````

5. Install module using maven
-----------------------------

````shell
mvn install
````

This step will create a directory called target/ which contains various directories and files.
Most importantly, there you will find the module executable:

nerc-en-1.0.jar

To run the program execute:

````shell
java -jar $PATH/target/nerc-en-1.0.jar -help
````

and the available options to execute the program will be displayed.


GENERATING JAVADOC
==================

You can also generate the javadoc of the module by executing:

````shell
mvn javadoc:jar
````

Which will create a jar file core/target/nerc-en-1.0-javadoc.jar
