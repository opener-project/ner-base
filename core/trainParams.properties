# ClearAdaptiveFeatures: ONLY WORKS with CONLL formats!!
# Specify if adaptive features are cleared in the training and/or evaluation data.
# Options are: 'yes', 'no', 'docstart'. The first two will reset the
# features every sentence whereas the 'docstart' option will look for -DOCSTART-

## Morphological Features ##
############################

# Morpho Features: add pos tag and lemma as a feature. It is required to provide
# the ixa-pipe-pos model and a plain text word\tlemma\tpostag dictionary for it to work.
# MorphoFeaturesRange specifies the combination of features to be used: options are 'pos',
# 'posclass' and 'lemma' in that strict order. For example, if 'pos,posclass,lemma' is
# chosen then all three types of features will be used. If 'pos,no,no' is chosen, then
# only pos tag features are active. If 'pos,no,lemma' then pos tag and lemma features,
# and so on.
# If MorphoFeatures is commented out, none these features are used.

# MFSFeatures: add Most Frequent Sense as features.
# It is required to provide an ixa-pipe-pos model, a plan text word\tlemma\tpostag
# dictionary and a lexicon containing the most frequent sense information, where
# each entry is of the form word#pos\tfreq#sense. For example, house#n\t1098#noun.artifact.
