IXA Wrapper for Apache OpenNLP NameFinder
-----------------------------------------

This module provides a simple wrapper that uses Apache OpenNLP
programatically to recognize and classify Named Entities (NERC)
in running text.

The English segmentation and tokenization models are distributed here:

http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/

The English NERC models have been trained using
CoNLL 2003 data and are provided by the IXA NLP Group (ixa.si.ehu.es),
University of the Basque Country.

Version 1.0 of nerc-en is being developed as part of the 7th Framework OpeNER European Project.
