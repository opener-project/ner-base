After three failed attempts, North Korea, though struggling to feed its people, is now one of the few  countries to have successfully launched a satellite into space from its own soil.

Bitter rival South Korea is not on the list, although it has tried. North Korean space officials insist the rocket is meant to send a satellite into orbit that can study crops and weather patterns.

But Western experts note that  the technology involved in a  satellite launch is similar to that needed to develop a very long-range missile.

The launch of a rocket similar in design to one capable of carrying  an atomic-tipped warhead as far  as California raises the stakes in  the international standoff over North Korea's expanding atomic arsenal.
